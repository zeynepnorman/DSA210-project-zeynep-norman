# DSA210 Project Proposal - Zeynep Norman

In this project, I aim to find whether recent increases of immigration to Europe affected the rise of nationalism in the region. To investigate the relationship between immigrants and nationalism, I will work with immigration data from EU countries, and vote share data of each EU country’s nationalist party. 

# Constructing the Hypothesis
Null Hypothesis (H₀): There is no relationship between recent increasing immigration to EU countries and increasing vote shares of nationalist parties in those countries.

Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): There is a causal relationship between recent increasing immigration to EU countries and increasing vote shares of nationalist parties in those countries. Rise of nationalism is connected to rise of immigrants in Europe. 

# Collection and Measurment of Data
To measure immigration, I will use annual crude rate of net migration to Europe ((number of immigrants – migrants) / population). I decided to use ratio values rather than actual numbers to eliminate biases such as global population increase that affects both number of immigrants and number of votes of each party. When searching for immigration rates of each country, I plan to use “Population change - Demographic balance and crude rates at national level” data, provided by official site of EU, Eurostat.  https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/demo_gind/default/table?lang=en 

To measure nationalism, I use each country’s most recent and most popular nationalist party’s vote shares from at least two recent elections. Then I will show the increase of nationalism by comparing each nationalist party’s vote shares at the last and previous elections that they participated in. When searching for parties and vote shares, I plan to use official election authority websites of the respective countries, pull data from researches on relevant topics, and use databases created for research purposes.
